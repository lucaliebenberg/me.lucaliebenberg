# Local Development

- Make sure that you have the latest versions of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- From the folder where you want to clone it, run:
```
`git clone https://github.com/lucaliebenberg/me.lucaliebenberg`
```
- Once cloning is complete, run `npm install` and `npm start`.
- You should now have a local server at `https://localhost:3000` that auto-refreshes when you make code changes.
